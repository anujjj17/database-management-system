Objective: In this task, we created a database to manage student records with three tables: Students, Courses, and Enrollments. The Students table contains personal details, the Courses table holds course information, and the Enrollments table links students to their courses, including grades. We inserted sample data and wrote SQL queries to manage records, retrieve information, and implement joins to combine data across tables.
